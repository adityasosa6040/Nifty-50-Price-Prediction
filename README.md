# Nifty-50-Price-Prediction
This Python code uses a deep learning model called an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to forecast the Nifty 50 stock index. It handles everything from downloading the latest financial data to visualizing future predictions.

# Nifty 50 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the closing price of the Nifty 50 stock market index (`^NSEI`). The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, and it fetches historical data from Yahoo Finance.

## üìú Overview

The notebook walks through the complete process of creating a time-series forecasting model:
1.  **Data Collection**: Fetches historical Nifty 50 data from 2010 to the present day using the `yfinance` library.
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and scales the data using `MinMaxScaler` to prepare it for the LSTM model.
3.  **Model Building**: Constructs a stacked LSTM model with multiple layers and Dropout for regularization.
4.  **Training & Evaluation**: Trains the model on 80% of the historical data and evaluates its performance on the remaining 20% using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ score.
5.  **Forecasting**: Predicts the Nifty 50 closing price for the next 30 days based on the last 60 days of available data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Architecture

The model is a Sequential model built with Keras, consisting of four LSTM layers followed by a Dense output layer. Dropout layers are included to prevent overfitting.

-   **Layers**:
    -   LSTM (50 units, `return_sequences=True`)
    -   Dropout (0.2)
    -   LSTM (50 units, `return_sequences=True`)
    -   Dropout (0.2)
    -   LSTM (50 units, `return_sequences=True`)
    -   Dropout (0.2)
    -   LSTM (50 units)
    -   Dropout (0.2)
    -   Dense (1 unit)
-   **Optimizer**: Adam
-   **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error
